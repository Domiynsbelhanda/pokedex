# Pokedex

App that lists all Pokemon and their details from [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/ "PokeApi"). This app is built with Flutter, focused on Android design.

For this poject Clean Architecture was choosen.  Beacause keep the code clean and tested are the two most important development practices. Even state management patterns like BLoC are not sufficient in themselves to allow for easily extendable codebase.

For this we should all strive to separate code into independent layers and depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.

Every "feature" of the app, like getting pokemons, is divided into 3 layers - presentation, domain and data. This app  have only one feature.

The presentation layer contain Pages, Widgets and Bloc. The presentation layer contain Entities, Repositories and Usecases. It should be totally independent of every other layer. The data layer consists of a Repository implementation and data sources - this is usually for getting remote (API) data.
